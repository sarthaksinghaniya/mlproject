# ðŸ“¤ OUTPUT EXPLANATION (FOR BEGINNERS / "Ghada")
# --------------------------------------------

# âœ… PART 1: Advertising Dataset Regression
# - We built a multiple linear regression model to predict 'sales' based on ad spending on TV, radio, and newspaper.
# - 'TV' has a strong positive impact on sales.
# - 'radio' has moderate impact.
# - 'newspaper' has almost no significant impact (p-value is high, so it's not useful).
# - R-squared value (around 0.89) shows that the model explains 89% of the variation in sales â€” that's very good.
# - p-values:
#   --> p < 0.05 = feature is statistically significant.
#   --> p > 0.05 = not significant (you can ignore it).
# - The regression summary also gives intercept and coefficients, which we can use to make predictions like:
#   Sales = a + b1*TV + b2*radio + b3*newspaper

# âœ… PART 2: Salary Dataset Regression
# - This is a simple linear regression with only one feature: YearsExperience.
# - Very high RÂ² (~0.95), means experience is a very strong predictor of salary.
# - Positive slope: more experience = higher salary.
# - Regression formula from output can be used to predict salary for any experience.

# âœ… Correlation Matrix Explanation
# - Shows how strongly two columns are related (range: -1 to +1).
#   --> +1 = strong positive relation
#   --> 0 = no relation
#   --> -1 = strong negative relation
# - Helps identify multicollinearity (if two features are highly correlated, one may be removed).

# ðŸ“Œ Summary:
# - Use regression when you want to predict something numeric.
# - Use correlation to understand which features move together.
# - Always check RÂ² and p-values to judge model quality.
